Web Chat is a dynamic web messenger application that allows users to interact with each other in real-time. Built using Vite, Handlebars, and SCSS, this application offers a seamless messaging experience with features like authorization, registration, messaging functionalities, and profile updates.

The application is deployed on Netlify, ensuring high availability and a streamlined deployment process. Netlify's continuous deployment feature automates the deployment process, allowing for instant updates to the live application with each push to the repository.

In the current implementation, the Express server is used exclusively for serving static web pages.
